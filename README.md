# Algorithm Visualizer

This project was made with the objective of showing how some algorithms work in a visual and more intuitive way.

### Personal goals
- Learn Typescript
- Learn algorithms (sorting, graph, trees, etc)
- Improve eslint knowledge
- Improve UI and UX knowledge
- Improve Figma skills, both for layout and icons
- Improve React, HTML & CSS skills

### Project goals
- Visualizations of:
  - Sorting algorithms (insertion, bubble, merge, quick)
  - Graph search algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*, Dijkstra)
  - Trees
- Step by step visualization (back and forth)
- Clean & Friendly UI

### Initial UI
Base UI design was made in Figma: https://www.figma.com/file/M59rzbPbC6vjNSNIJtDgYq/Algorithm-Visualizer?node-id=0%3A1
